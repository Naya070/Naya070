### About me🧑:
Hey there, GitHub friends! 👋<br/>
My name is Nayarith Jiménez, nice to meet you!<br/>
I'm a mechatronics engineer with a crazy love for web development, especially the backend magic. 🚀<br/>
These days, I’m deep in the world of backend development, playing with the coolest modern tech and frameworks.<br/>
My daily grind involves conjuring up robust and scalable apps using TypeScript and Node.js, with a sprinkle of NestJs for that extra kick. 💻✨ <br/>
I’m a PostgreSQL wizard, but I’ve also cast some spells with MySQL and SQLite. <br/>
And when it comes to APIs, I whip up some pretty slick and flexible ones with GraphQL. 🪄 <br/>
<br/>
In my past adventures as a full-stack developer, I've danced between crafting sleek user interfaces with React.js and building out solid backends.<br/>
This blend gives me a superpower: a full-circle view of the software development life cycle. 🌐 <br/>
This all-around experience helps me cook up complete and effective solutions. <br/>
<br/>
Quality is my middle name (well, not really, but you get it).<br/>
I’m all about rigorous testing, from unit tests with Jest to end-to-end (E2E) explorations with Postman. 🧪🔍<br/>
<br/>
I'm always on the lookout for new challenges and love adding a dash of value to every project I dive into.<br/>
If you’ve got questions or just want to chat, don’t be shy! Hit me up here or drop me an email at xxxxxxxxx@gmail.com.<br/>
<br/>
💌 Can’t wait to hear from you! 💌<br/>
