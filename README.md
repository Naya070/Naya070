### About me 👩‍🦰:
# Hey there, GitHub friends! 👋


My name is Nayarith Jiménez, nice to meet you!


I'm a $\huge{\textsf{mechatronics engineer}}$ with a crazy love for $\huge{\textsf{web development}}$, especially the backend magic. 🚀

These days, I’m deep in the world of $\huge{\textsf{backend development}}$, playing with the coolest modern tech and frameworks.

My daily grind involves conjuring up robust and scalable apps using TypeScript and Node.Js, with a sprinkle of Nest.Js for that extra kick. 💻✨

I’m a PostgreSQL wizard, but I’ve also cast some spells with MySQL and SQLite.

And when it comes to APIs, I whip up some pretty slick and flexible ones with GraphQL. 🪄

In my past adventures as a full-stack developer, I've danced between crafting sleek user interfaces with React.js and building solid backends.

This blend gives me a superpower: a full-circle view of the software development life cycle. 🌐

This all-around experience helps me cook up complete and effective solutions.

---

Quality is my middle name (well, not really, but you get it).

I’m all about rigorous testing, from unit tests with Jest to end-to-end (E2E) explorations with Postman. 🧪🔍

---

I'm always on the lookout for new challenges and love adding a dash of value to every project I dive into.

Don’t be shy if you’ve questions or just want to chat! Hit me up here or drop me an email at nayarith070@gmail.com.

💌 Can’t wait to hear from you! 💌
