### About me🧑:
# Hey there, GitHub friends! 👋

My name is <span style="color: #6a0dad;">Nayarith Jiménez</span>, nice to meet you!

I'm a <span style="color: #6a0dad;">mechatronics engineer</span> with a crazy love for <span style="color: #6a0dad;">web development</span>, especially the <span style="color: #6a0dad;">backend magic</span>. 🚀

These days, I’m deep in the world of <span style="color: #6a0dad;">backend development</span>, playing with the coolest modern tech and frameworks.

My daily grind involves conjuring up robust and scalable apps using <span style="color: #6a0dad;">TypeScript</span> and <span style="color: #6a0dad;">Node.js</span>, with a sprinkle of <span style="color: #6a0dad;">NestJs</span> for that extra kick. 💻✨

I’m a <span style="color: #6a0dad;">PostgreSQL</span> wizard, but I’ve also cast some spells with <span style="color: #6a0dad;">MySQL</span> and <span style="color: #6a0dad;">SQLite</span>.

And when it comes to APIs, I whip up some pretty slick and flexible ones with <span style="color: #6a0dad;">GraphQL</span>. 🪄

---

In my past adventures as a <span style="color: #6a0dad;">full-stack developer</span>, I've danced between crafting sleek user interfaces with <span style="color: #6a0dad;">React.js</span> and building out solid backends.

This blend gives me a superpower: a full-circle view of the <span style="color: #6a0dad;">software development life cycle</span>. 🌐

This all-around experience helps me cook up complete and effective solutions.

---

Quality is my middle name (well, not really, but you get it).

I’m all about rigorous testing, from <span style="color: #6a0dad;">unit tests</span> with <span style="color: #6a0dad;">Jest</span> to <span style="color: #6a0dad;">end-to-end (E2E)</span> explorations with <span style="color: #6a0dad;">Postman</span>. 🧪🔍

---

I'm always on the lookout for new challenges and love adding a dash of value to every project I dive into.

If you’ve got questions or just want to chat, don’t be shy! Hit me up here or drop me an email at <span style="color: #6a0dad;">nayarith070@gmail.com</span>.

💌 Can’t wait to hear from you! 💌
